"""No LIVE personal datum may enter this tree — and the allowlists are ENUMERATED here.

This repository is PUBLIC and Apache-licensed. A personal datum committed here is not
untidiness, it is disclosure: it ships to every clone, every mirror and every model that
scrapes GitHub, and it does so under a licence that invites redistribution.

**Why this guard exists.** A sweep on 2026-09-08 found one real person's mobile number used
as the input string of ``test_pii_hint_survives_state_round_trip`` — the same subscriber that
``cogno-host`` anonymised the same day on the private side, and that ``cogno-anima`` carried in
two bench fixtures. It arrived the way these always arrive: somebody reproduced a live turn and
pasted it, and the paste outlived the debugging session. The value was anonymised (never
deleted — see below); this exists so the next paste is caught by a machine instead of by the
next sweep.

**Anonymise, never delete.** The value of a fixture line is the MEASUREMENT it carries, and a
``git rm`` destroys it while a consistent synthetic preserves it. The form is kept — a phone
still looks like a phone — and the same entity gets the same fake across the ecosystem, so the
number this repo now uses is the one ``cogno-host`` chose for that subscriber. Anonymising a
fixture must not be the same act as breaking it. Here the proof is structural rather than
measured: the one site drives ``FakeNER(pii=["PHONE"])``, a double that answers ``PHONE``
whatever the input says, so the assertion is about the carry surviving a state round trip and
never about the digits. The string is there to look like a turn, and it still does.

**The allowlists are literal sets in this file, and that is the whole design.** A guard that
answered "is this number one of our contacts?" by querying the customer base would be a SECOND
copy of the problem — the repo would hold, or reach for, the very data it exists to keep out.
So the question it answers is the narrow one it can answer offline: *is this one of the
synthetics this repo has already agreed to use?* Anything else fails, including a real value
that belongs to nobody in particular. Adding an entry is a deliberate act, with a comment.

**What counts as a phone**, and why it is not "ten to thirteen digits": that would fire on
timestamps, ids, hashes and hex. A hit must be a Brazilian number by CONSTRUCTION — an
assigned area code (:data:`_DDD`), then either a 9-digit mobile opening with ``9`` or an
8-digit landline opening with ``2``-``5`` — optionally carrying the ``55`` country code and
the usual separators. The country code is stripped before comparison, so the same fake written
another way is one entry and not two: a value cannot slip through by being reformatted.

**The regex finds a SHAPE; the construction rules DECIDE.** This is inherited as a lesson, not
as a style. ``cogno-host``'s first cut spelled the mobile ``9`` into the pattern itself
(``9?[0-9]{4}``), which made the subscriber check unreachable — a mutation deleting that check
stayed green, because no input could ever arrive at it. Dead code inside a guard is a claim
the guard does not check. The pattern here therefore matches any 4-5 digit block and
:func:`phone_numbers_in` alone decides what is a number; both halves of that decision have a
mutation twin below.

**Enumerated with ``git ls-files``, not a walk of the disk.** An uncommitted file is not a
contract, and a scratch copy under ``tests/`` is not something this repo ever published. The
walk would also have to learn about ``.venv``, ``htmlcov`` and ``__pycache__``; the index
already knows.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH.** Stated here so nobody reads more into a green than is in it.

* **A person's NAME.** This is measured, not assumed. ``cogno-host`` ran its own 115-name
  lexicon over its tree: **732 firings across 90 of 422 files**, and of the **5** real names
  that had to be removed it would have caught **1**. A first name has no shape that separates
  it from a persona, a fixture or half the prose in a Portuguese repo, and the only way to
  raise the recall is to LIST THE REAL NAMES in the repo — which is re-leaking them. That
  class is a human review rule, and it is written where reviewers look (``README.md``): *if
  you quote a turn, anonymise the NAME and keep the SENTENCE.* Changing the words of a
  MEASURED quotation turns it into a FABRICATED one, which is why the rule is anonymise, not
  rewrite.
* **CPF/CNPJ.** A document number has exactly one structural property — its check digits — and
  every generator emits valid ones, so a real CPF and a synthetic CPF are indistinguishable by
  construction. A guard here could only be an allowlist with no filter in front of it, firing
  on every new legitimate fixture until somebody switched it off. The 2026-09-08 sweep found
  no document number of any kind in this repo, real or synthetic.
* **Addresses, postcodes, and tenant/session ids.** Same reason — no shape to key on that does
  not also fire on ordinary prose — and the sweep found none of them live here. Enumerating
  live ids in this file would import the very data it exists to keep out.
